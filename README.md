# Data-Visualization-Project
This project is aimed at analyzing and visualizing energy consumption data for buildings in New York City. The original dataset used in this project is the "nyc_benchmarking_disclosure_2017_consumption_data.xlsx" file.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to explore the energy consumption patterns in buildings across New York City, identify trends, and provide insights into energy-saving opportunities.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Before conducting any analysis, the data was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accuracy and consistency. The "Data Cleaning and Preprocessing.ipynb" file contains the Python code used for data cleaning and preprocessing. The cleaned data is saved in "my_data1.csv".

## Data Visualization
The "Visualizations - Dashboards.twb" file contains the Tableau workbook used to create interactive visualizations and dashboards. The "Data Viz Presentation.pdf" file contains a snapshot of the visualizations created in Tableau and a brief analysis of the insights obtained.

## Conclusion
The analysis and visualizations obtained from this project provide insights into energy consumption patterns in buildings across New York City. These insights can be used to identify energy-saving opportunities, reduce energy costs, and promote sustainable practices.
